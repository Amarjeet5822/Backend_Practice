# Morgan Middleware in Express.js

## 📜 Introduction
Morgan is a middleware in Node.js that is used to log HTTP requests. It works seamlessly with Express.js applications and helps developers track incoming requests, their status, response times, and other useful details — making it essential for debugging and monitoring.

## 🌟 Why Use Morgan?
- **Request Tracking:** Logs all incoming HTTP requests.
- **Debugging:** Helps identify bugs and performance issues by showing request details.
- **Monitoring:** Keeps track of request status codes, methods, and response times.
- **Customization:** Allows custom log formats tailored to specific needs.

## 🚀 Installation
To install Morgan, run the following command in your project:

```bash
npm install morgan
```

Or, if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn add morgan
```

---

## 📦 Basic Setup
Here’s how to use Morgan in your Express.js app:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');

const app = express();

// Use Morgan middleware
app.use(morgan('dev'));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

## 📜 Log Formats
Morgan provides various built-in log formats:

1. **dev**: Concise output colored by response status for development use.
2. **combined**: Standard Apache combined log output.
3. **common**: Standard Apache common log output.
4. **short**: Shorter than "common," but still effective.
5. **tiny**: Minimal output.

**Example:**

```javascript
app.use(morgan('combined'));
```
# 📜 HTTP Request Log Explanation 
```javascript
app.use(morgan('combined'));
```
## Log Entry
```
::ffff:127.0.0.1 - - [26/Feb/2025:10:43:31 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 23 "-" "Thunder Client (https://www.thunderclient.com)"
```

## 🔍 Detailed Breakdown

### **::ffff:127.0.0.1**
- This is the **IP address** of the client making the request.
- The `::ffff:` prefix indicates an **IPv6-mapped IPv4 address** — meaning it’s still `127.0.0.1` (localhost).

### **- -**
- These dashes are placeholders for optional information — typically, they represent the **remote user** and **authenticated user**.
- Since no authentication was involved, they remain as `-`.

### **[26/Feb/2025:10:43:31 +0000]**
- The **timestamp** of the request — in **day/month/year:hour:minute:second timezone** format.
- `+0000` shows the **timezone offset** (UTC in this case).

### **"GET / HTTP/1.1"**
- The **request line** includes:
  - `GET`: **HTTP method** used for the request.
  - `/`: The **requested URL path** — root route in this case.
  - `HTTP/1.1`: The **HTTP protocol version**.

### **200**
- The **status code** — `200` means **OK** (successful request).

### **23**
- The **response size** in **bytes** — meaning the server responded with 23 bytes of data.

### **"-"**
- This usually indicates the **referrer** — the page from which the request was made.
- `"-"` means **no referrer** was provided (like when the request came directly from an HTTP client like Thunder Client).

### **"Thunder Client (https://www.thunderclient.com)"**
- The **User-Agent** string — identifies the client (in this case, **Thunder Client** — a tool like Postman for testing APIs).

## 📈 Customizing Logs
You can create custom log formats using tokens:

```javascript
morgan.token('custom', (req, res) => {
  return `Method: ${req.method}, URL: ${req.url}, Status: ${res.statusCode}`;
});

app.use(morgan(':custom'));
```

---

## 📂 Logging to a File
You can log HTTP requests to a file instead of the console:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const logStream = fs.createWriteStream(path.join(__dirname, 'access.log'), { flags: 'a' });

app.use(morgan('combined', { stream: logStream }));
```

---

## ✅ Skipping Logs (Conditional Logging)
You can skip certain logs, for example, ignoring 404 responses:

```javascript
app.use(morgan('dev', {
  skip: (req, res) => res.statusCode < 400,
}));
```

---

## 🔥 Conclusion
Morgan is a powerful and flexible HTTP request logger for Express.js apps. Whether you're debugging, monitoring, or simply keeping an eye on incoming requests, Morgan simplifies the process with built-in formats and custom options.
